    <form  action="mailto:raideepa938@gmail.com" method="post" enctype="text/plain">
      <!--It is used to be <strong>"<form class="" action="mailto:raideepa938@gmail.com" method="post"></strong>
      and there are slight changes should be done so first delete this class and
      add another attribute called ENCODING TYPE i.e. (enctype),
      and this specifies just as up like were's specifiying
      that our website is encoded in UTF-8
      and we are going to say that the data in our form is encoded in plain text" -->
      <label>Your name:</label>
      <input type="text" name="yourname" value="">
<!--Here what we need to add is a value to each of these name attribute,
because that's going to identify the data that's inside each of these inputs. because it does some basic validation.
that means if we type something in our email input and try to hit enter it checks whether
the @ symbol and other things are correctly entered,it passes those basic validation checks,
but we got all of those validation checks for free just by changing our input type to email,
After we entered the message and submit button it'll lead us the mail page again and we can see now
that we've added something to that name attribute where it said yourname,yourEmail, yourMessage,
that what we added to the below inputs,now when we submit our form and we post this data
that the users inputted to our mail client ,then it knows how to classify each bit of the data,
i.e. name input should be labelled your name, email input should be labelled your email and likewise
message input will do -->      <br>
      <br>
      <label>Type your Gmail id :</label>
      <input type="email" name="yourEmail" value=""> <br>
      <br><br>
      <label>your message:</label>
      <textarea name="yourMessage" rows="10" cols="30"></textarea><br><br>
      <input type="submit" name="" >

    </form>
